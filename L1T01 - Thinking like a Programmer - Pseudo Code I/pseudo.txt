Scenario 1 - Highest positive number algorithm

Request user to input a positive number
If input equal to any positive number other than 0, repeat the request and save the previous input;
If the input is equal to zero, find the largest number value that was previously inputted and print that number to the user. 

Scenario 2 - Average algorithm calculator

Create an input mechanism, like a form field, to enter random  quantities of integers;
Build a calculator function linked to the input that adds each of the integer inputs together while simultaneously dividing the sum total by the number of integers entered 
to determine the average. The average output is displayed either in real time as the user enters more integers, or upon clicking on a "calculate average" button.

Scenario 3 - Grocery to-buy list

Build a 2 column spreadsheet, with column A being the grocery item and column B being the checklist. 
Build a function that connects the item in column A to the drop down option in column B, offering the option of "purchase"
Add all the products to purchase in column A;
If an item has been purchased, selected the 'purchase' option in column B, which can evaluate to true.
To determine what products are left to buy, click the filter button that activates a function that separates the list based on what items are linked to a true
and those which are not. 
Print the items which are not associated with true in alphabetical order and remove the items which have been evaluated as true. 

Scenario 4 - Algorithm flowchart calculator

Ask the user to add two integers in a field, namely 'number 1" and 'Number 2"
Store integer value A and value B;
Build a button linked to three calculation functions, namely:
Function S which adds the two user input integers together;
Function A which divides the sum of function S by 2;
Function P which multiplies function X & Y together;
When the button is clicked, it will execute the functions in the order of S, then A and the P and print the result of each in that corresponding
order to the user, namely result S then result A and then result P.
End
