First name algorithm

Request that the user inputs their name;
Store the user's input in a variable called first_name;
Access the variable and print out the variable first_name and the text " + "Hello, World".
If the user's name is Sally, it should translate to 'Sally, Hello World".

Age algorithm   

Request the user to enter their age;
Store the user's input in a variable called "age"
If the user's age is equal to or greater than 18, print out "You're old enough";
If the user's age is equal to and greater than 16 and smaller than 18, print out "Almost there";
If the user's age is smaller than and not equal to 16, print out "you're just too young".
In each evaluation the output will reference the age variable to determine the correct output.
