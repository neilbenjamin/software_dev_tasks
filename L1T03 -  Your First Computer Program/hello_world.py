# Pseudo-Code Solution

#Ask the user to input their name using the input command
#Store this input (argument) in a variable named 'name'
#Display the user's name with the print command calling the name variable
#Ask the user to input their age using the input command
#Store this input or argument in a new variable named 'age'
#Display the user's age with the print command calling the age variable. 
#Finally execute the print=("Hello World!") statement as the last execution.

#Code

name = input ("What is your name?")
print(name)
age = input("What is your age?")
print(age)
print("Hello World!")
