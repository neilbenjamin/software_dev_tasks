# We will first declare 4 variables, of which there will be a float, a string and two integer variables.
# We will then use the built in cast methods to change their types to as the task requires.
# I have also added in additional typ() prints to showcase the change in the type.

#initial types
num1=99.23
num2=23
num3=150
string1="100"

#cast types
num1=int(99.23)
num2=float(23)
num3=str(150)
string1=int("100")

print(num1)
print(type(num1))
print()
print(num2)
print(type(num2))
print()
print(num3)
print(type(num3))
print()
print(string1)
print(type(string1))
