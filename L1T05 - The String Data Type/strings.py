# Utilize the string strip method to remove the $'s off the end and start of the string 
# by utilizing the built-in python method, "strip". I've added the strip method on to the print function
# but also included a commented out example on how to achieve this by assigning it to a new variable with the 
# same outcome which could be useful if it needed to be used elsewhere. 

#Task 1

hero = "$$$Superman$$$"
print(hero.strip("$"))

# broke_hero = hero.strip("$")
# print(broke_hero)
